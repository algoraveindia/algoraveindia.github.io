*An Algorave Anniversary Performance by **Algorave India Community***

Algorave India is turning 7, and we're marking the moment with 7th Orbit: Generative Generation — a special night of live-coded sound and visuals on May 11 at Mool. This celebration is presented in collaboration with W.I.P Labs, an alternative art organisation based in New Delhi that supports experimental and interdisciplinary art practices.
Since 2018, Algorave India has been creating a space for artists, coders, musicians, and designers to come together and explore the creative potential of live coding. Drawing from a global movement where code becomes performance, we've been building a vibrant community that blends art and technology in unexpected ways.
For this 7th anniversary edition, we’re bringing together 10 audio-visual artists for an evening of generative noise, visuals, and collective energy. Come celebrate with us!

Date: **11th May, 2025**

Time: **7:30 PM Onwards**

Venue: [Mool](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e9BS8piFg2dt3z696)

# Artist Lineup

- **Aasma Tulika** is going to mix some PureData patches with recorded samples from the city and some groovy beats to dance to.
- **Kaushal Sapre** hacked his old keyboard and managed to rewire its electronics to create some really old school bit-tunes with PureData.
- **Dine Fining** will turn patterns and cycles into grooves and noisy tunes with TidalCycles.
- **Decoy Dhruv**, a visual poetic wizard, is planning to make his visuals dance to the audience using Touchdesigner.
- **rnd.exe** is going to be trying his hand at livecoding in punctual. He doesn’t know anything about how to make music but will try to make weird and funky visuals.
- **Imerohi** learnt how to code last month. Now, he's a live-coder you might wanna keep an eye and ear out for.
- **Shaakar** questions live-coding and intends to use the atmosphere of the space to determine his visuals and responses.
- **beatnyk's** work is a constant battle to not crash his live-coding system while creating noisy mayhem in an attempt to code earworming rhythms.
- **Tig3rbabu** will be performing and live-coding in Sonic pi some electro-pop versions of classic tunes along with some originals from the vault.
- **Khoparzi** will bring in his usual improvised generative visuals tickled by chaotic algorithms meddling with signals and systems
