Algorave ‚Äì a word coined to give an identity to events that use open source code and hardware as an instrument/paintbrush to perform live in front of a diverse, inclusive and accepting audience. Algoraves are centred around creative coding tools where programming code is written and manipulated live in full view of the audience to produce sounds and visions to bend minds and jiggle behinds.

AltFest by BLR Hubba and WIP Labs (Nov 30 - Dec 15) features over 500 events in 10 categories across 40+ venues.

BLR Hubba has something for everyone and a venue near you. Most Homegrown and Enabled events are free to attend. Explore them and more on this website. See you at BLR Hubba.

üìÖ - 2nd Dec

‚è∞ - 7:30PM - 9:30 PM onwards live music mayhem

üìç - Bangalore Creative Circus

[Tig3rbabu](https://www.instagram.com/tig3rbabu/) will be performing and live-coding in Sonic pi some electro-pop versions of classic tunes along with some originals from the vault.

[Farah](https://www.instagram.com/farahmulla/) and [Khoparzi](http://khoparzi.com/) will play with custom sound tools built in Reaktor and Max/MSP generating soundscapes with granular synthesis and machine learning algorithms tickled by repetitive envelopes, LFOs and pose estimation of movements across the space.

[Roguentropy](https://www.instagram.com/roguentropy/) Will give us a sonic pi set paired with a flute.

[Sourya Sen](http://www.instagram.com/ayruos) returns to working with DIY code and electronics, performing an improvised set with a handheld AV synth of his own design, the N8IR.

[Khoparzi](http://khoparzi.com/) will bring in his usual improvised generative visuals tickled by chaotic algorithms meddling with signals and systems. Later the party will degenrate to livecoded footwork and bass music powered by TidalCycles.

[beatnyk](https://instagram.com/beatnyk) beatnyk's work is a constant battle to not crash his livecoding system while creating noisy mayhem in an attempt to code earworming rhythms.
