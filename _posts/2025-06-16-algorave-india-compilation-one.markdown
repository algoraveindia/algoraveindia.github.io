**Crowdfunding campaign for Algorave India Compilation One**

We're excited to share that our crowdfunding campaign is now live for a project we've been building for the past few months. It’s a compilation of 10 algorithmic music tracks created by artists from the Algorave India community, paired with 10 generative zines by visual artists from the code.drift collective.

We’re raising funds to support the release—this includes producing USB editions, printing zines, and covering artist fees and distribution. If you've ever wanted to support experimental art, now’s a great time.
