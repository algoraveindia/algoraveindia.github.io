Hot on the heels of upcoming performances in Pune, Algorave India in collaboration with Music Tech India brings you an algorave at another unique venue in Mumbai. As part of the Music Hack Day India 2019, we are organising a Algorave at Studio CAMP.

Please register at https://musichackdayindia.github.io/register and we'll send you direction and the exact address. It also helps to follow our Instagram page @algorave_india where we'll be posting up to the minute details and walkthroughs to the venue.

Algoraves are events centered around performers/artists who use various creative coding technologies to create music and visuals. Artists present their programming code in full view of the audience, while it is manipulated live to produce sounds and visions to bend minds and jiggle behinds.

Artists:

Bio:
substance D

substance_D is an experimental artist exploring electro- acoustic improvisation, data manipulation, algorithmic compositions, and sensor-based music. He likes to indulge in wood, electronics, metal, mud and anything that has structural binding and makes strange objects. His footprint is largely anonymous and emerges out periodically. He catalogs tribal dance, folk tales, acoustic information and conducts informal learning sessions in the himalayan villages with the school kids on understanding sound and computer codes. Active soul in the fab lab’s spread across via the common thread of internet and trying to push creative coding using various approaches like workshops, performances, talks and informal meet-ups. Been an integral part of the Algorave sub culture in India.
