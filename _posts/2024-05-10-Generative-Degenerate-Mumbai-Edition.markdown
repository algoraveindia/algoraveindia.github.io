Algorave ‚Äì a word coined to give an identity to events that use open source code and hardware as an instrument/paintbrush to perform live in front of a diverse, inclusive and accepting audience. Algoraves are centred around creative coding tools where programming code is written and manipulated live in full view of the audience to produce sounds and visions to bend minds and jiggle behinds.

Generative Degenerate is a month long tour of Algorave India across multiple cities to celebrate the birth of the collective six years ago.

### Bios:

Farah Mulla is a multimedia artist based in Mumbai. With a background in science, her art practice investigates different media. Rather than being a formal exploration of sound and visual fields, her work renders the human bodies of visitors as a medium, as much as the electronic circuits and softwares she uses. Curious about sensation and perception processes, Farah uses sensorial interfaces in an attempt to deploy a language that gives form to intangible and varied materials. Her research and art practice explores the space in between sensory thresholds, where harmony isn‚Äôt present in the environment but fabricated by our cognition. Approaching the invisible agency of sound, light and time via diffractive modes of enquiry, she experiments with sensory overlaps, ambient ecologies and materiality through different texts, sounds, and circuits. Where the interface becomes a site that attributes the work its interactive affordance and form.
