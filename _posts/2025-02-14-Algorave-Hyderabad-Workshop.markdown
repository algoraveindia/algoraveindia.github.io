Algorave comes to Hyderabad for the first time!

Beats and Banter x Algorave brings you beginner-friendly Live-Coding Music Workshop at The Moonshine Project and learn everything you need to create and perform your first live-coded set! Dive into Strudel for real-time music coding, and audio engineering basics‚Äîno prior experience needed! By the end, you‚Äôll have the skills to take the stage in Hyderabad's burgeoning Algorave community. Facilitated by Abhinay @khoparzi (Algorave pioneer) and Harsha @xyzzy_music (musician/programmer). Just bring a device, headphones, and your creativity!

Algorave @algoraveindia short for algorithmic rave, is a performance format and underground movement that revolves around the practice of live-coding, that is, writing and editing code live in front of an audience to create music and visuals. Live coding has been a medium for performing arts for almost three decades, but it was usually restricted to either the art world or tech and trans-media events. Since 2012, UK-based musicians , livecoders decided to take live coding into the club environment, organizing live coding jams at local music venues under the Algorave banner.
